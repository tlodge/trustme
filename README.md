# The shape of trust
<img src="./banner.png"></a>
<p>
This was a project in collaboration with the Imagination Lab at Lancaster University.  It seeks to bridge the gap between engineers and laypeople's understanding of autonomous AI systems. It presents a set of scenarios that participants are asked to respond to; seeking answers across dimensions of knowledge, choice and risk.  At the end users are presented with a composite shape that represents their particular view on autonomous AI.
